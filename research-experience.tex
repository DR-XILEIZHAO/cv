\section{Research Experience}
	\cventry{2010-present}
		{Computer Scientist}
		{\href{http://www.llnl.gov}{Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory}}{}{}
		{As team leader for the Performance Analysis and Visualization at Exascale (PAVE) project,
		 investigating more intuitive ways to visualize and analyze performance data.
		 On the Exascale Computing Technologies (ExaCT) Strategic Initiative and on SciDAC SUPER project, researching
		 scalable performance tools for machines with millions of cores.  Projects include Muster, a library for
		 massively clustering massively distributed data sets; Libra, a scalable load balance analysis tool, and
		 other HPC performance tool projects.  In spare time, deploying collaboration tools for software developers.}

	\cventry{2009-2010}
		{Postdoctoral Scholar}
		{\href{http://www.llnl.gov}{Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory}}{}{}
		{Developed $O(log(P))$ clustering algorithm for on-line analysis in parallel tools.
		 Developed optimizations for stack tracing library using stack smashing instrumentation.  Researched techniques for
		 scalable performance analysis as part of ExaCT project.  Led initial HPC thrust
		 of strategic power grid modeling project.}
